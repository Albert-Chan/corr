The term has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for coining or at least making it popular.[14][15] Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.[16] Big Data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, however the main focus is on unstructured data.[17] Big data "size" is a constantly moving target, as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data.[18] Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from datasets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale.[19]

In a 2001 research report[20] and related lectures, META Group (now Gartner) defined data growth challenges and opportunities as being three-dimensional, i.e. increasing volume (amount of data), velocity (speed of data in and out), and variety (range of data types and sources). Gartner, and now much of the industry, continue to use this "3Vs" model for describing big data.[21] In 2012, Gartner updated its definition as follows: "Big Data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation."[22] Gartner's definition of the 3Vs is still widely used, and in agreement with a consensual definition that states that "Big Data represents the Information assets characterized by such a High Volume, Velocity and Variety to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value".[23] Additionally, a new V "Veracity" is added by some organizations to describe it,[24] revisionism challenged by some industry authorities.[25] The 3Vs have been expanded to other complementary characteristics of big data:[26][27]

Volume: big data doesn't sample; it just observes and tracks what happens
Velocity: big data is often available in real-time
Variety: big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion
Machine learning: big data often doesn't ask why and simply detects patterns[28]
Digital footprint: big data is often a cost-free byproduct of digital interaction[27][29]
The growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between big data and Business Intelligence:[30]

Business Intelligence uses descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things, detect trends, etc..
Big data uses inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identification[31] to infer laws (regressions, nonlinear relationships, and causal effects) from large sets of data with low information density[32] to reveal relationships and dependencies, or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors.[31][33]
